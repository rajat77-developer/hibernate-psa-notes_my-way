Hibernate
#######################

-> Hibernate is an ORM (Object relation mapping) tool
-> It helps developers map Java classes to database tables and automate CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) without writing complex SQL queries.


Example: Entity Class Employee

@Entity
public class Employee {	
	@Id
	private int id;
	private String name;
	private float salary;
	
	//setters
	public void setId(int id) {
		this.id = id;
	}
	
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public void setSalary(float salary) {
		this.salary = salary;
	}

	//Getters
	public int getId() {
		return id;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public float getSalary() {
		return salary;
	}
	
}

1. @Entity - “This annotaion maps Java class to a table in the database.”
2. @Id   - Indicates the primary key column, and is mandatory to define inside entity class


What is JPA?
JPA (Java Persistence API) is only a specification — meaning it is a set of interfaces and incomplete annotations

What is hibernate?
The Implementation of JPA is done in hibernate and other ORM tools like EclipseLink, OpenJPA, DataNucleus

Note:

🔹 JPA = What to do
🔹 Hibernate = How to do it (plus extra power)

Hibernate Mappings
######################

a. OneToMany Mapping - One entity (parent) is associated with many instances of another entity (child).
-> @OneToMany
Example:
1. One Post has many Comments
2. One Hotel can have many reviews
3. One Hotel can have many Bookings
4. One Customer can place many Orders

b. ManyToOne Mapping - where many child entities relate to one parent entity.
-> @ManyToOne
