Hibernate
#######################

-> Hibernate is an ORM (Object relation mapping) tool
-> It helps developers map Java classes to database tables and automate CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) without writing complex SQL queries.


Example: Entity Class Employee

@Entity
public class Employee {	
	@Id
	private int id;
	private String name;
	private float salary;
	
	//setters
	public void setId(int id) {
		this.id = id;
	}
	
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public void setSalary(float salary) {
		this.salary = salary;
	}

	//Getters
	public int getId() {
		return id;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public float getSalary() {
		return salary;
	}
	
}

1. @Entity - “This annotaion maps Java class to a table in the database.”
2. @Id   - Indicates the primary key column, and is mandatory to define inside entity class


What is JPA?
JPA (Java Persistence API) is only a specification — meaning it is a set of interfaces and incomplete annotations

What is hibernate?
The Implementation of JPA is done in hibernate and other ORM tools like EclipseLink, OpenJPA, DataNucleus

Note:

🔹 JPA = What to do
🔹 Hibernate = How to do it (plus extra power)

Hibernate Mappings
######################

a. OneToMany Mapping - One record in Table A matches with multiple record in Table B
-> @OneToMany
Example:
1. One Post has many Comments
2. One Hotel can have many reviews
3. One Hotel can have many Bookings
4. One Customer can place many Orders

b. ManyToOne Mapping - Multiple records in Table A matches with one record in Table B
-> @ManyToOne

c. ManyToMany Mapping - In Hibernate, a Many-to-Many relationship is used when each record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table and vice versa. 
For example, 
a. Student can enroll in many Courses, and a Course can have many Students.
b. One Bus can travel to many stops, and one stop can have many buses

d. OneToOne Mapping - One Record in Table A matches with exactly One Record in Table B
-> @OneToOne
For Example:
One Person can have one KYC
